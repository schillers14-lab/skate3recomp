// spread test is what rejects a FOREIGN palette that lands coincidentally
// in view: the player's trucker cap draws exactly ONCE per frame (main
// pass, palette at c7) while leftover rows at c4 pass the norm checks,

// both projects in-clip and keeps a sane spread; the caller then refuses
// the capture and the post-draw fixup retries on a later draw.

// (the ropa flag row read exactly (1,...) from the mesh's own bank; every
// capture site guarantees own-draw provenance now, so the foreign-bank
// hypothesis the strict gate defends against is off the table). When the

// at a sane spread: up close the garment fills/overflows the screen and
